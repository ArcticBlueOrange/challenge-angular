# Angular Challenge :trophy:
Welcome to the Angular challenge! <br />
Your task is to implement several features. To get started, we'll provide you with a starter project that includes some basic routes, CSS, and an API call. This will help you hit the ground running and focus on the features you need to build. <br /> 
Good luck!
# Features :memo:
This app has the following features to help you find and enjoy your favorite TV shows:
- Search bar to find your favorite TV shows
- A view that groups all the TV shows by genre
- Theme switch (dark/light theme) 
- Detail page of a TV show
- Profile page where you can set theme preference and the user email

Feel free to rearrange the starter code as you see fit.
## Start up the project :rocket:
Run `npm install` or `yarn install` to install all the dependencies then run `ng serve` for a dev server. <br />
Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
